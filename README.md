## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a versatile software engineer with 3 years of experience, mostly working across the stack with JavaScript, TypeScript, Node (Nestjs), and React. I have a CS degree, but most of what Iâ€™ve learned has come from building real products in fast-paced, early-stage startups.

That experience taught me to be a product-minded engineer who takes ownership of my work. Iâ€™ve built products used by 100k+ monthly users, improved performance, and contributed to growing company revenues.

I'm interested in teams with a strong engineering cultureâ€”where people are kind, have fun, and build great products together. Open to fullstack or backend roles

Main skills include: JavaScript, TypeScript, Node, RESTful APIs (Nest.js), React.js, PostgreSQL, AWS, Jest, Python, etc.

Also interested in working professionally with Golang

And I love tennis btw ðŸŽ¾
