## Hi there 👋

I'm a versatile software engineer with 3 years of experience, mostly working across the stack with JavaScript, TypeScript, Node (Nestjs), and React. I have a CS degree, but most of what I’ve learned has come from building real products in fast-paced, early-stage startups.

That experience taught me to be a product-minded engineer who takes ownership. I’ve built products used by 100k+ monthly users, improved performance, and contributed to growing company revenues.

I'm interested in teams with a strong engineering culture—where people are kind, have fun, and build great products together. Open to fullstack or backend roles

Main skills include:
- Javascript
- Typescript
- Node
- RESTful APIs (Nestjs)
- React.js
- Agile
- AWS
- Postgresql
- Jest
- Python

Also interested in working professionally with Golang

And I love tennis btw 🎾
